Inspiration: This project was inspired by a tic tac toe lab that we did (separately) in Intro to CS I which was a Tic-tac-toe game, though we did not review the original project before working on our project and none of the original code was used.

It uses the PyQt5 framework and the QtDesigner application for the GUI.
